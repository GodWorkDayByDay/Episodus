What Is Indy?</DIV>
<P CLASS="Element10">
Internet Direct (Indy) is an open source internet component suite comprised of popular internet protocols. Both client and server implementations are included as well as full source code and comprehensive demos.<P CLASS="Element10">
Indy is an open source internet development library for the Borland Delphi, C++ Builder, and Kylix product lines, and is based entirely on blocking sockets. The Indy Client components are easy to use because you write your transactions in a sequence. The Indy Servers are multithreaded.<P CLASS="Element10">
<DIV CLASS="Element15">
The Indy Licenses</DIV>
<P CLASS="Element10">
Indy is dual licensed. You can review which license better suits your needs, and use that license. You can even change your mind later if you have previously chosen one.<P CLASS="Element10">
<DIV CLASS="Element15">
The Indy BSD License</DIV>
<P CLASS="Element10">
The Indy BSD license is a very no nonsense license that allows you to do almost anything you want with Indy, provided you provide proper attribution. The Indy BSD License can be found at http://www.nevrona.com/Indy/BSDLicense.html .<P CLASS="Element10">
<DIV CLASS="Element15">
The Indy MPL License</DIV>
<P CLASS="Element10">
To make it easier and consistent for JEDI users, we also offer an MPL v1.1 (Mozilla Public License). The Indy MPL License can be found at http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html .<P CLASS="Element10">
Mozilla is the Open Source initiative formulated by Netscape for the next generation of their web browsers. Netscape states &quot;We believe this license satisfies the Debian Free Software Guidelines which provide a commonly accepted definition of &quot;free software,&quot; much like other free software licenses such as GPL or BSD.&quot;<P CLASS="Element10">
Project JEDI's implementation of the MPL allows developers to use its code in their applications (&quot;Larger Work&quot;) regardless of whether the intended distribution will be in the public domain or as commercial applications, as long as the license conditions are met. For a more detailed explanation, an annotated version of the MPL (http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/annotated.html) is available.</DIV>

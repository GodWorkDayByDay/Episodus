The files in this directory are used to test and debug libgocr, and the source
code may be useful to developers. Here's a brief description of what they are
supposed to do:

charfind.c: locates some characters and outputs another image, to debug. Shows
	some charFind functions.
image.c: opens an image and prints it.
imagewrite.c: opens an image, defines a block that covers it in full and outputs
	another image. Shows block functions and debugging.
module.c: opens a module (available at the homepage) and runs it.
